# Hide-and-Seek

Created in Unity, Hide and Seek is a game between one single AI who seeks and several other hiders on scene.
Hide and seek is, in my opinion, a great beginnings in the study of AI in general. This project alone utilizes A* pathfinding, a basic state machine, and raycasting.

# Purpose

Goals:
A general understanding of the A* algorithm, its ... math parts. Yes, math. Math. Slope-intercept stuff.
Learning to create a real state machine, because lets face it switch statements are mad inefficient for this.
Turning raycasting into actual vision via camera eye-like objects! Raycasting is cool, but it's not really vision, ya know?

# The Real Question

Hide and seek is a very human game. And AIs tend not to be very human. Especially scripted ones in Unity Engine.
So, can we teach an AI through machine learning how to seek and hide effectively, learning only from their environment?
